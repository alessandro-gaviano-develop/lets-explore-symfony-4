# Beginners Symfony 4 Tutorial

Welcome to Symfony 4. If you're brand new to Symfony in general then this is the place I recommend you start. This is my absolute beginners guide to Symfony 4.

In this tutorial we are going to cover:

* Downloading Symfony 4, and getting your Symfony site up and running
* Creating pages using Routing, Controller, and Twig Templates
* Capturing visitor information such as their name, email, and date of birth using Symfony Forms
* Sending Emails
* Getting geeky with our very first service

This is going to be hands on, rather than lots of theory.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive dive into every Symfony feature. There will be links to relevant Symfony documentation, and Best Practice guidance should you want to dive deeper.

We're here to explore. We're going to prioritise fun and hands-on practical experience. And we're going to learn a lot along the way.

If you like this series then you'll love the rest of Code Review Videos. Mostly the content covers Symfony, and using other modern tools and techniques to make working with your Symfony sites as productive and enjoyable as possible.
